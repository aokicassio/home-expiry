# home-expiry

This initial project is a Spring Boot, REST webservices and Mongodb  simple application.

For study purposes I implemented some REST endpoints to create a Product Expiration note to help me monitoring food going off at home.

This is a start of a series of "Home" applications with simple ideas that I have in mind.

Technical specs to be added soon to this landing README.
